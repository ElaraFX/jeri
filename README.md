# JERI Website

## Development

The website is expected to run in the root of a web server. You can run one with __one of__:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000 # Python 2
python3 -m http.server 3000 # Python 3
npm install -g serve && serve -s . # JavaScript
```

This will run a server in the current directory and make it available at `http://localhost:3000`.
